# **Introduction**


Chicago is the third largest city in the USA, but is regarded by a lot of people as one of the most dangerous cities in the country. History and Hollywood created the image of Chicago with gangs and violence. But is this still true? Is Chicago still regarded as unsafe, or has Chicago improved in the last couple of years? Does gang violence still have a prominent role in the everyday life of an average person living in Chicago? This data story will investigate the crime numbers in Chicago and will answer the question of whether life in Chicago has improved compared to other US cities.




## Perspective 1: Tackling Crime in Chicago Requires Targeted Solutions
Although Chicago is often portrayed as a city plagued by uncontrollable crime, this image is overly simplistic. Crime in Chicago is highly concentrated in specific neighborhoods and is largely driven by deep-rooted social inequalities. Therefore, an effective response should not rely on general repression, but rather on targeted investments in the most vulnerable areas.


### Argument 1: Crime is geographically concentrated
Data shows that the vast majority of violent crimes occur in a limited number of neighborhoods or streets. This indicates that the issue is not citywide, but rather linked to specific areas that have been systematically underserved. A blanket policing strategy across the entire city is inefficient. Instead, localized efforts—such as community-based interventions and neighborhood policing—are more effective in reducing crime in these high-risk zones.

### Argument 2: Crime in Chicago has been gradually declining, especially during the COVID-19 years
Although crime remains a serious concern in Chicago, overall crime rates have shown a slow but steady decline over the past decade. This trend became particularly noticeable during the COVID-19 pandemic, when certain types of crimes—such as burglary and robbery—dropped significantly due to lockdowns, reduced street activity, and increased police presence. While some violent crimes persisted, the overall data suggests that societal shifts during the pandemic contributed to a temporary reduction in many forms of crime. This shows that environmental and social conditions can have a major influence on crime trends.



## Perspective 2: Understanding Crime Through Police Districts Reveals Structural Inequality
Looking at crime statistics by police district in Chicago reveals a deeper, structural issue: crime is not evenly distributed across the city, and this unevenness reflects long-standing social and economic inequalities. To truly address crime, we must consider how resources and policies are applied across different districts.

### Argument 1: High-crime districts often face underinvestment
Districts with the highest crime rates often overlap with areas that have faced decades of disinvestment, poor public services, and limited economic opportunity. These conditions contribute to higher crime, yet these same districts often receive less proactive community support compared to wealthier, lower-crime areas. Understanding crime through the lens of district-level data helps highlight where resources should be focused to create long-term change.

### Argument 2: Policing strategies vary significantly between districts
Not all police districts operate in the same way. Some focus more on community engagement, while others rely heavily on reactive or aggressive tactics. These differences can impact how residents perceive safety, trust the police, and report crimes. Viewing crime through district patterns allows for more tailored and effective policing strategies that respond to the specific needs of each community.
